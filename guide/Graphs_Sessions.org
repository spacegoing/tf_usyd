** Basics

Note that tf.Tensor objects are implicitly named after the
~tf.Operation~ that produces the tensor as output. A tensor name
has the form ~<OP_NAME>:<i>~ where:

- ~<OP_NAME>~ is the name of the operation that produces it.
- ~<i>~ is an integer representing the index of that tensor among
  the operation's outputs.



** Snippets

** Gotchas

*** Avoid memory issues
Note: By default, TensorFlow will create a new tf.Tensor each
time you use the same tensor-like object. If the tensor-like
object is large (e.g. a numpy.ndarray containing a set of
training examples) and you use it multiple times, you may run out
of memory. To avoid this, manually call tf.convert_to_tensor on
the tensor-like object once and use the returned tf.Tensor
instead.
