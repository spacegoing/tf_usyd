Note that tf.Tensor objects are implicitly named after the
tf.Operation that produces the tensor as output. A tensor name
has the form "<OP_NAME>:<i>" where:

- "<OP_NAME>" is the name of the operation that produces it.
- "<i>" is an integer representing the index of that tensor among
  the operation's outputs.
